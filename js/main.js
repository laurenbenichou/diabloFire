After the burn, the blackened, charred  stalks of burned chamise stood over the scorched and newly-open landscape, seemingly devoid of any living vegetation. But soon, within a matter of months, green shoots started sprouting from the base of this deep-rooted plant. Two years later, the \u201cchamise curtain\u201d on the mountain has begun to close again, on its way to shading out and outcompeting the fire followers.

True fire followers, they swarm to wildfires, congregating en masse while the flames are still burning, and lay their eggs under the surface of charred wood. Firefighters encounter the beetles at most forest fires and wear bee veils to protect themselves from the swarming insects off.

Tarantulas won\u2019t outrun a fire \u2013 but many could have survived the Morgan Fire by retreating to their underground burrows, where it\u2019s much cooler. Two years later, the tarantulas are on the move once again.

The combination of newly cleared open space and drought kept competition with nonnative grasses to a minimum and led to two of the best wildflower seasons ever seen on the mountain.

This might be due to increased abundance of their preferred food sources resulting from fire-related insect hatches as well as increased availability of cavity nest sites in burnt snags (provided the snags are left standing)."},{id:"fremont",name:"Fremont\u2019s Star Lily",latin:"Toxicoscordion Fremontii",description:"Bulb plants like the Fremont star lily took advantage of the reduced competition for sunlight, water, and nutrients after the fire to grow abundantly in the first spring after the fire. The fact that it is an early spring bloomer probably helped it that first spring. The star lily was less abundant the second spring, as chamise and other wildflowers took over."},{id:"brewer",name:"Brewer\u2019s Red Maids",latin:"Calandrinia Breweri",description:"The bright magenta Brewer\u2019s red maids is a fire follower collected by legendary botanist Mary Bowerman following the major 1977 fire on the north side of Mount Diablo.

The plant\u2019s pale yellow, star-shaped flowers growing on one-to-four-foot high resinous stems had only rarely been spotted on Mount Diablo over the previous four decades.

The bright orange blossoms blanketed the north side of the mountain after the 1977 fire there, but had not been seen on the mountain since. Botanists spotted them in May 2014, and then again in greater numbers in the spring of 2015. Now they might not be seen again until the next fire. (Fire poppies appear very similar to the more common wind poppy, but has a yellow instead of magenta center.)"},{id:"snake",name:"Alameda Whipsnake",latin:"Masticophis Lateralis Euryxanthus",description:"The federally threatened Alameda whipsnake is found only in scrub and chaparral habitat in Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara and western San Joaquin counties.
